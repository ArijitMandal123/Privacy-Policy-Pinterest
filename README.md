# Privacy-Policy-Pinterest

### **Privacy Policy**

**Last updated:** January 20, 2026

**1. Introduction**
Welcome to **n8n automation** (the "Application"). This Application is a personal automation integration developed by **Arijit Mandal** (the "Developer") for the purpose of synchronizing and scheduling content to Pinterest boards.

The Developer respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through compliance with this policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use the Application and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

**2. Information We Collect**
Our Application is designed for **personal automation** purposes. We minimize the data we collect to strictly what is necessary for the Application to function.

* **Voluntarily Provided Information:** We may collect information that you voluntarily provide, such as image URLs, board IDs, and text descriptions intended for publication to Pinterest.
* **Usage Data:** The Application serves as a conduit between your local environment (or n8n instance) and the Pinterest API. We do not store personal user data, browsing history, or behavioral tracking data.
* **Log Data:** Like most applications, our hosting service (e.g., n8n self-hosted server) may collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Application, including your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser version, pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and other statistics.

**3. How We Use Your Information**
We use the information we collect strictly for the following purposes:

* To authenticate with the Pinterest API on your behalf.
* To create, upload, and manage Pins on your specified Pinterest boards.
* To maintain and improve the functionality of the automation workflow.

**4. Third-Party Services**
This Application integrates with third-party services. We do not control these third parties and are not responsible for their privacy statements.

* **Pinterest API:** We use the Pinterest API to facilitate the posting of content. By using this Application, you acknowledge that your data (specifically images and captions you choose to upload) will be transmitted to Pinterest. Please review [Pinterest's Privacy Policy](https://policy.pinterest.com/en/privacy-policy) for more information.
* **n8n:** This Application is built using the n8n workflow automation tool. Please review [n8n's Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://n8n.io/privacy-policy) for details on their data handling practices.

**5. Data Retention**
The Application acts as a pass-through service. We do not permanently store your content (images or descriptions) on our servers after the automation task has been completed. Authentication tokens (OAuth keys) are stored securely and encrypted within the application's credential manager solely for the purpose of maintaining connectivity with Pinterest.

**6. Data Security**
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All transmission of information between the Application and the Pinterest API is conducted over HTTPS/TLS encrypted connections.

**7. Children’s Privacy**
Our Application is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

**8. Changes to Our Privacy Policy**
It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically visiting this privacy policy to check for any changes.

**9. Contact Information**
